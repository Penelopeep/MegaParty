## Usage:
1. Make party that you want in normal party slots (you can use all 4 teams, party order matters)
2. Use /tm or /party in in-game chat with server (or without "/" in console)

**Optional:**
Is you want to change something in current big party then go to party setup and click on quick setup, it should allow you to change characters and their order just by clicking on both of them and clicking them in reverse order.

## FAQ

1. How to install plugin?
    - Add the newest jar file from [here](https://github.com/Penelopeep/TeamMerge/releases), and put it in **GrasscutterFolder/Plugins** (make one if you don't have)
2. Plugin says that it can't change server settings:
   - Well, I added this as a safety measure, but I have no clue what could cause this. Just open **config.json**, press **ctrl+f** and search for **singlePlayerTeam**
3. After changing config.json I still can't make bigger parties
   - Dm me on discord **Penelopeep#7963** since in this case it will be probably error which don't occur on my pc.
4. Just use /team add
   - I'm lazy and I thought it's cooler, also it's easier because /team requires avatarId but plugin just takes it from game
5. Your error handling sucks
   - You're right, if you know how to make proper error handling or how to get data from **config.json** then make pull request or dm me on discord **<a href="https://discord.com/users/276265598508466176">Penelopeep#7963</a>**
